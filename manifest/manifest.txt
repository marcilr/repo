Manifest


A repo manifest describes the structure of a repo client; that is the
directories that are visible and where they should be obtained from with git.

The basic structure of a manifest is a bare Git repository holding a single
'default.xml' XML file in the top level directory.

Manifests are inherently version controlled, since they are kept within a Git
repository.  Updates to manifests are automatically obtained by clients during
`repo sync`.
