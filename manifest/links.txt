Re: repo + private repositories in github
o Very simple manifest file here.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
<manifest> 
  <remote name="myproject" fetch="git@github.com:myproject/" />
  <default revision="master" remote="myprojecy" /> 
  <project path="someapp" name="someappe" remote="myproject"/> 
</manifest> 
NOTE: Think the above needs to use the canonical ssh url ssh://
      syntax to specify the idenity.
o Also has ssh and ~./ssh/config notes.
