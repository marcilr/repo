repo - The multiple repository tool


Repo is a tool that we built on top of Git.  Repo helps us manage the many Git
repositories, does the uploads to our revision control system, and automates
parts of the Android development workflow.  Repo is not meant to replace Git,
only to make it easier to work with Git in the context of Android.  The repo
command is an executable Python script that you can put anywhere in your path.
